**tugHall** _(**tu**mor **g**ene-**Hall**mark)_ is a cancer-cell evolution model simulator, wherein gene mutations are linked to the hallmarks of cancer, 
which influence tumor cell behaviors. 

This is an _**R**_-based script to simulate the cancer cell evolution in the framework of the model proposed by _**Prof. Mamoru Kato**_,
_Head of Bioinformatics Department, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, JAPAN_.

Short description
---
The wide availability of recent cancer genomic data requires a coherent model that can sort out the relevant findings to systematically explain the clonal evolution and resultant intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). Here, we present a new mathematical model designed to computationally simulate the evolution of cancer cells. The model connects well-known cancer hallmarks with the specific mutational states of tumor-related genes. The cell behavior phenotypes are stochastically determined and the hallmarks interfere probabilistically with the phenotypic probabilities. In turn, the hallmark variables depend on the mutational states of tumor-related genes. Thus, it is expected our software can be used to deepen our understanding of cancer-cell evolution and generation of ITH.
